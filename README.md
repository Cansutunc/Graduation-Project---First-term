# Graduation-Project---First-term
In this project our aim is to improve printed products from 3d printer and detecting failrues on the products to increase productivity. In that purpose we are using image processing for detecting failrues on the printed objects. In this semester we are focusing on the printed products. In image processing part we are focusing on 2 main parts as pre image processing for making the images that are taken from cameras turning into processed images and developing algorithms for detecting failrues on the processed images.
